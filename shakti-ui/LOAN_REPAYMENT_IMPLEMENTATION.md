# Loan Repayment Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the loan repayment feature for the Shakti Ledger platform, covering both frontend UI/UX and backend logic.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **RepayLoan Component** (`src/components/RepayLoan.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Complete repayment interface for borrowers
- **Features**:
  - Real-time USDC balance checking
  - Smart contract allowance verification
  - Two-step process: Approve → Repay
  - Progress indicators and status updates
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Auto-calculation of remaining loan amount
  - "Max" button for quick repayment
  - Beautiful, responsive UI with status indicators

#### 2. **Repayment Hooks** (`src/hooks/useRepayLoan.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Smart contract interaction for loan repayment
- **Features**:
  - Uses wagmi's `useWriteContract` for blockchain calls
  - Transaction confirmation tracking
  - Error handling
  - Integration with Shakti Vault ABI

#### 3. **Backend API Hooks** (Updated `src/hooks/useBackendApi.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Integration with backend API for repayment tracking
- **Features**:
  - `useRecordRepayment()` - Record repayment in database
  - `useLoanRepayments()` - Fetch repayment history
  - `useLoanSummary()` - Get comprehensive loan status
  - React Query integration with cache invalidation

### Backend API

#### 4. **Database Schema** (Updated `prisma/schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model LoanRepayment {
  id             String       @id @default(cuid())
  amount         BigInt
  repaidAt       DateTime     @default(now()) @map("repaid_at")
  txHash         String       @map("tx_hash")
  proposal       LoanProposal @relation(fields: [proposalId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  proposalId     String       @map("proposal_id")
  @@map("loan_repayments")
}
```

#### 5. **API Endpoints** (Updated `src/index.js`)

##### POST `/api/loans/:proposalId/repayments`
- **Purpose**: Record a new loan repayment
- **Body**: `{ amount: string, txHash: string }`
- **Returns**: Repayment record with success status

##### GET `/api/loans/:proposalId/repayments`
- **Purpose**: Get all repayments for a loan
- **Returns**: List of repayments + total repaid amount

##### GET `/api/loans/:proposalId/summary`
- **Purpose**: Get comprehensive loan status including repayments
- **Returns**: Complete loan data with repayment status, remaining amount, etc.

### Smart Contract Integration

#### 6. **Updated ABI** (`src/abi/shaktiVault.ts`)
- Added `repay` function definition
- Supports BigInt amount parameter

#### 7. **USDC ABI** (`src/abi/mockUsdc.ts`)
- **Purpose**: ERC20 token interactions for USDC
- **Functions**: `approve`, `allowance`, `balanceOf`

### UI/UX Integration

#### 8. **Loan Detail Page** (Updated `src/app/vault/[id]/loan/[loanId]/page.tsx`)
- **Integration**: RepayLoan component appears for borrowers
- **Conditions**: Only shown when:
  - User is the borrower
  - Loan has been disbursed
  - User wallet is connected
- **Features**: Auto-refresh on successful repayment

## 🚀 User Flow

### For Borrowers (Loan Repayment)

1. **Navigate to Loan Details**
   - Go to `/vault/{vaultId}/loan/{loanId}`
   - Only borrower sees repayment section

2. **Check Repayment Status**
   - View total loan amount
   - See amount already repaid
   - View remaining balance
   - Check USDC balance

3. **Enter Repayment Amount**
   - Input amount to repay (up to remaining balance)
   - Use "Max" button for full repayment
   - Real-time validation

4. **Two-Step Process**
   - **Step 1**: Approve USDC spending
     - Calls `approve()` on USDC contract
     - Sets allowance for vault contract
   - **Step 2**: Execute repayment
     - Calls `repay()` on vault contract
     - Transfers USDC to vault

5. **Confirmation & Updates**
   - Transaction confirmation
   - Backend records repayment
   - UI updates with new status
   - Repayment history visible

## 🛡️ Security & Validation

### Frontend Validation
- ✅ Amount must be > 0
- ✅ Amount cannot exceed remaining loan balance
- ✅ User must have sufficient USDC balance
- ✅ Smart contract allowance verification
- ✅ Borrower-only access control

### Backend Validation
- ✅ Required fields validation
- ✅ Loan proposal existence check
- ✅ Transaction hash recording
- ✅ BigInt amount handling for precision

### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ Uses established ERC20 approve/transfer pattern
- ✅ Amount validation on contract level
- ✅ Borrower authentication on contract level

## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. User Input (Amount) 
   ↓
2. Frontend Validation
   ↓
3. USDC Approve Transaction
   ↓
4. Vault Repay Transaction
   ↓
5. Backend API Call (Record Repayment)
   ↓
6. Database Update
   ↓
7. UI Refresh (React Query Cache Invalidation)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- **React Query**: API calls and caching
- **wagmi**: Blockchain state and transactions
- **Local State**: Form inputs and UI state

### Error Handling
- **Transaction Failures**: User-friendly error messages
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms
- **Validation Errors**: Inline form validation
- **API Errors**: Graceful degradation

### Performance Optimizations
- **React Query Caching**: 10-second stale time for loan data
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only load RepayLoan for borrowers
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before blockchain confirmation

## 🧪 Testing

### API Testing
- Created `test-repayment-api.js` for endpoint testing
- All endpoints return proper JSON responses
- Error handling tested for edge cases

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Frontend Integration**: Test RepayLoan component in browser
2. **Blockchain Integration**: Test with real transactions on testnet
3. **Database Operations**: Verify repayment records are stored correctly
4. **End-to-End**: Complete repayment flow from UI to database

## 🚦 Deployment Status

### ✅ Completed
- Backend API endpoints
- Database schema migration
- Frontend components
- React hooks integration
- Smart contract ABI updates

### 🔄 Next Steps
1. **Frontend Testing**: Test RepayLoan component in browser
2. **Blockchain Testing**: Deploy and test on Sepolia testnet
3. **UI Refinements**: Polish based on user feedback
4. **Documentation**: Add user guides and API documentation
